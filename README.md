# Python Recommendation Software: Book Recomender 

## Overview
This is a portfolio project for my Codecademy Computer Science course. For the project, I was tasked with creating a recommendation software in Python. I chose to create a book recomender. As an avid reader, I hoped this program would make it easier to select my next read!

## Key Features
- Utilized sets and intersection to narrow down what book genres.
- Used bubble sort to arrange the books in alphabetical order for the user to view.
- Created a book class, which stores all information pertaining to each book (ie: title, author, rating, description, etc).
- Integrates lessons learned in Introduction to Python, Data Structures & Algorithms on Codecademy

## Technologies Used
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Object Oriented Programming
- Recursion
- Bubble Sort*

*Author's Note: I know Bubble Sort is extremely inefficient... I used it in this program for educational purposes only. 

## Usage
To get personalized book recommendations, simply:
1. Download the folder.
2. Run the software. 
3. Follow the promtps.
3. Recieve your personalized book recommendation!
